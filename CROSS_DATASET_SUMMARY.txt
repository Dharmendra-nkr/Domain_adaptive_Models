## Next Steps for Cross-Dataset Validation

To expand generalization testing:

### 1. NCBI Disease Dataset
- Single entity type (Disease only)
- Domain: Medical documents
- Expected F1: 85-90%

### 2. CRAFT Dataset
- Full-text biomedical corpus (vs abstracts)
- Multiple entity types
- Expected F1: 78-85%

### 3. Domain Adaptation Tests
- Evaluate on clinical notes (if available)
- Test on patent documents
- Measure performance degradation
